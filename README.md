BERT Text Classification

The aim of this project is to experiment with BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to build up a better sentiment analysis ML model. I have used PyTorch library to quickly and efficiently fine-tune a model to get near state of the art performance in sentence classification. More broadly, I describe the practical application of transfer learning in NLP to create high performance models with minimal effort on a range of NLP tasks.

This project combines all of the steps in solving a problem, from the pre-processing of dataset to model building, evaluation, and deployment.
